This is a "satellite" plugin for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).

== Description ==

The [Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT)](https://bmlt.app) is a powerful client/server system for locating NA meetings.
The "root server" is a standalone Web site, but "satellite servers" are set up to point to the "root." This is a "satellite," set up as a WordPress plugin.
It is very easy to install and use. It has an administration panel that lets you choose a map center, designate the root, set up the map zoom, and whether or not older browsers are supported.

== Installation ==

This is a standard WordPress plugin. Either use the in-dashboard installer, or move the main directory into the wp-content/plugins/ directory and activate it.
