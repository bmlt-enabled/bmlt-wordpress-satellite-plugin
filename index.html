<p>Contributors: magblogapi, radius314, pjaudiomv, jbraswell Plugin URI: <a href="https://bmlt.app">https://bmlt.app</a> Tags: na, meeting list, meeting finder, maps, recovery, addiction, webservant Author: bmlt-enabled Requires at least: 4.0 Tested up to: 6.0.2 Stable tag: 3.11.0</p>
<p>This is a "satellite" plugin for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).</p>
<p>== Description ==</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bmlt.app">Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT)</a> is a powerful client/server system for locating NA meetings. The "root server" is a standalone Web site, but "satellite servers" are set up to point to the "root." This is a "satellite," set up as a WordPress plugin. It is very easy to install and use. It has an administration panel that lets you choose a map center, designate the root, set up the map zoom, and whether or not older browsers are supported.</p>
<p>== Installation ==</p>
<p>This is a standard WordPress plugin. Either use the in-dashboard installer, or move the main directory into the wp-content/plugins/ directory and activate it.</p>
